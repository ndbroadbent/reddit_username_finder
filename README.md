# Reddit Username Finder

There's only a few 3 letter usernames (a-z) left. You can use this Ruby script to find them.

### Usage

```bash
./find_usernames.rb
```

* **Pink:** Taken
* **Red:** Taken by a deleted account
* **Green:** Available


### How it works

The script will check 1000 random 3 letter usernames containing lowercase alpha characters.
You can alter the script however you like. You could include numbers, add a fixed letter prefix, etc.
You could alter it to search for dictionary words, or variations of a specific word.

Just don't hammer Reddit's servers too much.
